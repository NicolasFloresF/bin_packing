## Bin Packing Optimization Using Genetic Algorithm

This project is a simple implementation of a genetic algorithm to solve the bin packing problem. The bin packing problem is a combinatorial optimization problem in which items of different sizes must be packed into a finite number of bins or containers each with a fixed capacity. The goal is to minimize the number of bins used. The genetic algorithm is inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms.
